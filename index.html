            <h1>Hi, I'm Bodi Irvine, an Aspiring Software & Game Developer</h1>
            <p>
                 I’m an aspiring software and game developer fueled by a passion that 
                sparked with my first "print" command in Python. Since then, I’ve been 
                on a mission to master as many programming languages as I can, tackling 
                every challenge head-on. From Python to SQL, I’m building skills through 
                projects that blend code and creativity—check them out below!

                <h2>Guessing game</h2>
                <p>
                    A cool python project where you have choose a random number 
                    between 1 and 50. after each incorrect guess the computer 
                    will tell you weather or not your guess was too heigh ot too low.

                <p>
                    Another Cool python project, in this project you play rock paper scisors agenst a computer. 
                    The program will track weather or not the computer won and will also track weathor or not the 
                    game was a draw. how evere once you terminate the project the score will not save. the way you 
                    exit the game is by typeing 'end_game'.
